District of Commerce and Artistry in the [[City of Brass]]

The [[Pyraculum]] is a renowned district within the [[City of Brass]], a metropolis located on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and ruled by the mighty Sultan Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, King of the Jinn. Nestled in the heart of the city’s sprawling obsidian avenues, the Pyraculum serves as the primary hub of commerce and craftsmanship, where trade, artistry, and invention converge in dazzling—and often dangerous—harmony.

Overview
The Pyraculum is famed for its eternal forges, lava-fed kilns, and a bazaar that never sleeps, illuminated by ambient flames and the shimmer of molten brass. Merchants, genies, planar wanderers, and fire-touched artisans fill the streets with their wares—ranging from enchanted weapons and elemental-infused armors, to volatile elixirs and artworks forged from living flame.

Among its bustling streets lies the Street of Artisans, a winding corridor of creativity where master crafters—both mortal and elemental—compete for prestige and patronage. Every tool, tapestry, or trinket sold here bears the unmistakable mark of fire-born ingenuity. Some whisper that even soul-forging takes place behind closed doors, where contracts and craft become indistinguishable.

The Fountain of Clearest Azure
Anomalous amid the heat and ash, the Fountain of Clearest Azure rests at the center of a marbled plaza in the Pyraculum. This mystical water source, fed by an unknown elemental spring, glistens with a hue impossibly blue, untouched by the flame that surrounds it. It is said to have purifying and memory-restoring properties, and its waters are highly sought after by seers, diviners, and exiles seeking clarity of purpose.

Legends claim that the Fountain marks the site of an ancient pact between water and fire, sealed long before the Sultan’s reign. Though its guardians remain unseen, no violence is permitted near the Fountain—any such act is met with instantaneous and unexplained incineration.

Adventurers and the Pyraculum
For those brave (or foolish) enough to traverse the [[City of Brass]], the Pyraculum offers both boon and bane. Here, knowledge may be bought, secrets traded, and rare magical reagents uncovered. But beware—the market's rules are the Sultan's laws, and those who break them risk everything.

The Fountain of Clearest Azure, in particular, is a point of interest for planar pilgrims, mystics, and adventurers such as the bearer of the Arcane Codex. To gaze upon its surface is to risk stirring old memories… or awakening truths long buried.
