|  Roll Range | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2           | A Lady of Pain shadow passes over the city. All sound ceases. A nearby berk who looked up turns to ash. No explanation. No aftermath.                                              |
| 3–4         | A Planewalker’s corpse slams into the cobblestone from a portal above—clutching a sealed letter addressed to [[Fana]]. Its wax bears the symbol of The Star.                           |
| 5–6         | A dervish of fire dances through the street, leaving no burn marks—only whispers of a tournament in the [[City of Brass]].                                                             |
| 7–8         | A Harmonium patrol demands the party present permits. Problem is, the permits they expect are from another plane entirely.                                                         |
| 9–10        | A strange beast—a limbless floating toad with runes carved into its flesh—offers cryptic riddles. It explodes into petals if answered correctly. Flies away if not.                |
| 11–13       | A faction recruiter (Dustmen, Sensates, Takers, etc.) hassles the party to join their cause. They're irritatingly persuasive.                                                      |
| 14–16       | A pickpocket tries to lift a coin pouch. If caught, they reveal they were planting something, not stealing. A small rune-stone pulses with power.                                  |
| 17–19       | A small-time sorcerer offers to sell “a bottled memory of love” for 10 gold. Drinking it reveals a past life—possibly not your own.                                                |
| 20–21       | A portal opens midair, dropping a Modron who promptly dusts itself off and states, “Query: Local tavern. Strongest drink. Existentially effective.”                                |
| 22–23       | [[Zazir]] spots an ex-lover or rival and panics. It escalates into a street chase or chaotic reunion with tales of betrayal, pies, and theft.                                          |
| 24–25       | A stall in the Bazaar is selling “genuine illusions”—images that can’t be touched, smelled, or heard, but feel real in the mind. One matches [[Fana]]’s dream.                         |
| 26–27       | A Chaosman gang (Xaositects) performs a backwards mugging—they throw coin purses at people while shouting nonsensical threats. One of the coins glows faintly.                     |
| 28–29       | A trio of Guvners and Anarchists debate in the street over the Lovers Arcana Page. They don’t name it outright, but their argument could expose useful leads.                      |
| 30–31       | A street preacher shouts, “The Codex is being rewritten! The World walks again!” Most ignore him—but a cloaked figure nearby is listening intently.                                |
| 32–33       | A book merchant's cart overturns, scattering arcane tomes. One book crawls away like a crab. Another tries to bite [[Fana]]. One glows warmly in her presence…                         |
| 34–35       | A Sensory Stone vendor offers an illegal experience called “The Frozen Moon”. If sampled, it grants a glimpse of Icewind Dale... and something watching from beyond.               |
| 36–37       | A portal opens to the Lower Ward, and out stumbles Agnizzar the Smoldering, half-drunk, declaring he’s “lost the spark again!” and must find Alarra before the “coal dies out.”    |
| 38–39       | A strange wind passes through the ward. Everyone pauses. A few mutter prayers. Those with Runes (like Thorn) feel them pulse. Something is stirring in the Codex.                  |
| 40          | A ripple in reality—the sky folds inward for a moment. The sun (which shouldn’t be there) winks at [[Fana]]. Time skips backward 6 seconds. Everyone else acts as if nothing happened. |
