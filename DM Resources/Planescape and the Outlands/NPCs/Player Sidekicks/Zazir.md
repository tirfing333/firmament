###  Backstory
 Born in a crawlspace beneath the Hive Ward and raised on lies, laughter, and hunger, Zazir learned early that in [[Sigil]], it’s not what you _know_, but how fast you can sell it. He earned his moniker “Many-Tongued” from the ever-changing stories he spins—none of them true, all of them useful. Street rat turned runner, runner turned fixer, fixer turned self proclaimed tout… it’s hard to pin down when Zazir became indispensable.
	
	 He’s made deals with Dustmen, outrun the Harmonium, and stolen from the Fated—twice. Most recently, he’s become tangled in a dangerous web involving a certain Sensory Stone, a sorceress from beyond the stars, and some very sharp people with very sharp interests.

###  Personality
 Zazir is fast-talking, faster-running, and unrepentantly slippery. He speaks in a mix of street slang, borrowed idioms, and the distinctive [[Sigil]] Cant. He claims to be "everybody's friend" Yet he’s strangely loyal to [[Fana]]—not out of duty, but curiosity. He wants to _see where this story goes_.

###  First Encounter with [[Fana]]
In the chaos of the [[Market Ward]], Zazir approached [[Fana]] with a grin and a bargain: help him deliver a package for a shady merchant, and he’ll show her the ways of [[Sigil]].
