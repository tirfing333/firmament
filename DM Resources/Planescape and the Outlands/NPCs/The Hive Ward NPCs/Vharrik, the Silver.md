###  **Appearance & Personality**

**Tall, proud, and merciless**, Vharrik is a **silver-scaled dragonborn** clad in a sleeveless black coat of etched metal rings—each link etched with the **[[Sigil]] of the Duskmire**. His draconic eyes are like shards of frozen steel, ever-calculating, ever-watching. The **white mist of his breath** never ceases, even when he speaks.

He fights with one hand on a curved longsword whose blade is chilled silver—his signature weapon known as _"Frostlash."_ When not sheathed, it emits a **low, frosty hum**. 

Vharrik the Silver is not a brute—he is a **professional**, cold and cruel. He considers mercy a weakness and respects only **discipline, loyalty, and raw power**.

###  **Personality Traits**

- **Always calm in battle.** Never raises his voice unless invoking his draconic power.
    
- **Keeps a ledger of names**—those who owe him, those who crossed him, and those who died screaming.
    
- **Loathes chaos.** Views Xaositects and Anarchists as filth beneath his boots.
    
- **Wears a platinum ring etched with runes*. It signifies **his trusted status** in the Syndicate.

Vharrik aims to become the kingpin of the Hive Ward. He has recently come into possession of a magical artifact of great power, however he struggles to understand what it is capable of. There are rumors that people who cross the crime lord have been disappearing mysteriously without a trace. Emboldened by the artifact he has found, he has begun to make moves in the Hive Ward in an attempt to consolidate control.

Vharrik has made countless enemies in the Hive, one of which is the Lady Skirra Vren, who plots his downfall.
