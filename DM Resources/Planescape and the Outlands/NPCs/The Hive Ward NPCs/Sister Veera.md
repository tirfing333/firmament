Human Healer of the Forgotten

- **Storefront**: _Veera’s Remedies_, a sagging canvas tent hung with dreamcatchers, bloodroot bundles, and bells that chime when secrets are spoken.
    
- **Appearance**: Red Hair. She wears patchwork robes stitched from discarded cloth and faction symbols, each bearing a story.
    
- **Personality**: Soft-spoken and wise, though her words carry weight like a spell. The Hive folk call her “Mother Mercy,” but the gangs whisper she’s “The Whisper-Witch.”
    
- **Hooks**:
    
    - **Memory Balms**: She crafts rare tinctures that restore fragments of lost memory—but they come with dreams of places you've never been.
        
    - **Faction Ties**: Veera once served the **Bleak Cabal**, but left after a traumatic vision that shattered her nihilism.
        
    - **Hidden Truth**: Keeps a **wounded celestial feather** in her hidden apothecary room, saying “it fell here… long before the war ended.”
