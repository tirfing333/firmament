- A crooked-backed, wrinkled crone with beady eyes that seem to peer through souls.
- Speaks in measured, hushed tones, as if revealing forbidden knowledge with every word.
- Doesnâ€™t deal in coin, only in secrets, favors, and hidden truths.
- She rarely smiles, and when she does, it is knowing, unsettling, or oddly maternal.
