### ❖ Garret "Ironmug" Thorne (Barkeep & Owner)

 Personality:  
  
- Gruff but fair, no patience for nonsense, but treats good customers with respect.
- Likes stories, dislikes complainers—will gladly give a free drink if a tale is good enough.
- Has a thick, deep voice like rolling thunder, and grumbles constantly.
- Hates bards ("Singin’ don’t pay the tab, friend.").

 Quirks & Catchphrases:    

- "If ye ain't drinkin’, ye ain't stayin’."
- "Startin' trouble? Then ye’d best finish yer drink first."
- "That’s the last warning, cutter. I don’t care if ye be a pit fiend, a gith warlord, or a bloody sodding god. My bar, my rules."
- "Try the stew, or don’t. Either way, it’s already paid for."

 Rumors He Might Share (for a Price or a Favor):  
  
- "I don’t trust that fence Nails. He’s got eyes on all the wrong folk."
- "A [[Guvner]] was here last night, real nervous-like. Kept glancing at the door."
- "That fortune-teller, [[Fira]]? She don’t blink often enough. Not natural."
- "One of them [[Sensates]] left somethin’ in my back room. I ain’t touched it, but I ain’t movin’ it either."
