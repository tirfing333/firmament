Sigil (pronounced: /ˈsɪgɪl/ SIG-il), also known as the Cage, the City of Doors, or, less commonly, the City of Secrets, was a floating city in the center of the Outlands and the self-proclaimed center of the multiverse in the Great Wheel cosmology. A major hub for interplanar travel, the city contained multiple portals to every single plane, as well as to numerous locations in the Prime Material Plane. It was considered a demiplane in the World Axis cosmology.
