## **The Lady’s Ward**

The Lady’s Ward is the richest, most orderly, and most imposing district in all of [[Sigil]]—a cold marble mask perched above a city of grime and chaos. Named not for its highborn residents but for the Lady of Pain herself, this ward hosts [[Sigil]]’s most powerful figures, both lawful and lawless. It is a realm of cold ambition, where secrets thrive behind stone façades and iron gates, and where silence is more dangerous than shouting.

Palatial estates known as the **High Houses** dominate the skyline, each one older than the lords who reside within. The City Barracks, the City Court, and the dread Prison—all monolithic, somber structures—stand as monuments to law and fear. This is the domain of the **Harmonium** and the **Mercykillers**, and their combined presence ensures a quiet that is more oppressive than peaceful. Most street-level crime is nonexistent here, not for lack of villainy, but because the crimes of the Lady’s Ward are committed behind closed doors and under false names. Grand thefts, extortion rings, and magical blackmail are the province of its well-dressed elite​.

Despite its sterile calm, the ward teems with veiled activity. Its sprawling noble estates and temple complexes are the chosen homes of proxy servants of powerful gods—divine wanderers and traveling deities whose temples display extravagant splendor. While no true power may enter [[Sigil]], their proxies are here in abundance: servants of Zeus, Gruumsh, Odin, Primus, Corellon Larethian, and many more. Even the divine are swept into the ward’s relentless game of politics, intrigue, and betrayal​.

In the Noble District, **Shemeshka the Marauder**, a yugoloth of considerable wealth and influence, reigns from the shadows as the self-styled “King of the Crosstrade.” Her schemes stretch across [[Sigil]] and beyond, and her hand can be found in anything from portal extortion to the trafficking of secrets​.

Temples to wandering and creator deities stand alongside embassies of the planar elite, forming a quiet, gilded theater for the endless chess game of [[Sigil]]’s upper crust. Lavish masquerades, forbidden affairs, and whispered betrayals fill the halls and salons of the High Houses. Knowledge is power in this place—and too much of it can see a cutter cast into the void by decree, or worse, forgotten entirely​.

The Lady’s Ward is polished stone hiding a rusted blade. Here, power is cold and deliberate, wealth is armor, and trust is the most expensive currency of all.
