**Residential**

- Bormul House - Upper City (Manorborn). Possible adventure hook - silent, undead killer.

- Eomane House - Upper City (Manorborn). Possible adventure hook - Nysene Eomane is a psycho who invites non-upper-class people to her home to trap them there after the gates close so she can make cruel sport of them.

- Hhune House - Upper City (Manorborn). Possible adventure hook: Location from which the Shield of the Hidden Lord was stolen. Owned by elderly widow Lutecia Hhune. Her cambion, Kaddrus, is trying to find who stole the Shield. Possible adventure hook 2: Lutecia is also trying to find a suitable heir. Guild-connected librarian, Virmele, is looking through records to find one - but is also being bribed by people who want to inherit the Hhune’s wealth and historic maps and antiquities. 

- Ramazith’s Tower - Upper City (Temples). Possible adventure hook: Lorroakan, the wizard who now occupies the tower, does not venture above the first and second floors. He is not a very good wizard. He believes that the secret to Ramazith’s vast wealth lie in the floors above, and he is looking for hired hands to explore it and discover what it holds.

- Rillyn House - Upper City (Manorborn). Home of the Rillyn School, run by Yvandre Rillyn, who trains students in sword-wielding. The first class, who have trained for five years, are about to graduate. Possible adventure hook: Students who didn’t cut it feel humiliated and hold a grudge against Yvandre and her school. 

- Vanthampur Villa - Upper City (Temples). Home of Duke Vanthampur.

- Mandorcai’s Mansion - Lower City (Bloomridge). Possible adventure hook: This mansion appeared out of nowhere decades ago. The owner, Mandorcai, would hold lavish parties for Lower City residents. Then, he stopped, and vanished. People subsequently invited to the house also vanished. The Flaming Fist checked it out; all but two disappeared, and the two remaining were suffering from PTSD and talking about a murder house. It has been boarded up since, with no one willing to go near it or tear it down. In actuality, it is a hell house, currently filled with cultists who plan to use it for nefarious purposes. 

- Seskergates - Lower City (Bloomridge). Possible adventure hook: Once owned by a wealthy family, now owned by Imbralym Skoond, a mage. Skoon is the Council of Four’s wizard. He employs four alchemists and several guards whose job is to search the winding corridors of Seskergates for a lost magical tome while mapping out the place. A nothic hangs out in the bowels of Seskergates. The nothic is also searching for the tome and spies on the mage and his apprentices. It knows many secrets. 

### **Shops/Businesses**
- Distant Shores - Upper City (The Wide).
	- Dried meats, spices, authentic cookware, and traditional recipes from Port Nyanzaru. Recent vandalism because people want to buy the shop and they won’t sell. 

	- Proprietors: Tendai and Khennen Shore (human)

- Harbreeze Bakery - Upper City (The Wide). 
	- Baked goods, teas, spices. A place to hear and get gossip.

	- Proprietor: Ellyn Harbreeze (human) - knows all the gossip!

- The Wide - Upper City (The Wide). 
	- Outside of the actual shops here are a bunch of stalls and vendors selling any manner of goods. Fortune-tellers and con artists sit beside dealers hawking spices, fish, furs, perfumes, and every other luxury good to be found across the continent and beyond.Well-regulated - the Watch is looking out for pickpockets. No street musicians. 

	- Proprietor: Jedren Hiller, human bandit, who assigns stalls. Possible adventure hook: Hiller is super corrupt and everyone knows it. He gives preferential treatment and expects large bribes to get it. 

- Baldur’s Mouth - Lower City (Heapside). 
	- The city’s paper, with a populist bent. Possible adventure hooks: You can put literally any adventure hook in the paper, for one thing. Also, Needle is always looking for adventurers to do some investigative work. You could tie a hook here into another hook, or have him give a different hook to go investigate.

	- Proprietor: Ettvard Needle, human

- Candulhallow’s Funeral Arrangements - Lower City (Heapside). 
	- Run by moon elves of the family name. Wooden carts come and grab the dead around the city. Possible adventure hook: These people are super corrupt. They smuggle contraband in corpses for Nine-Fingers Keene, and also sell body parts and corpses to the city’s cultists and necromancers. Leylenna Candulhallow, the family matriarch, is a necromancer moon elf herself, and has put together some kind of necromantic abomination using these illegal body parts. 

	- Proprietors: The Candulhallow family, including Leylenna Candulhallow

- Eastway Expeditions - Lower City (Eastway). 
	- Sells adventuring gear and jungle exploration gear. Due to the death of many people who ran off to Chult, there is a 10-day waiting period on buying adventuring gear here. Because of this, the proprietor runs a side-business: if anyone needs to get out of Baldur’s Gate with immediacy, she can set you up. You won’t get to choose where you go, though.

	- Proprietor: Scalm Shilvin, tiefling

- Felogyr’s Fireworks - Lower City (The Steeps). 
	- Colored smoke streams out of this shop’s orifices. The only producer of smokepowder in the city. Lower floors are a showroom for lesser alchemical wonders and fireworks. The upper floors are reserved for workshops. Possible adventure hook: Someone recently broke in and stole four kegs of smokepowder (9d6 damage if a keg blows). They left a drawing of a phoenix. He wants to quietly hire someone to track down the missing smokepowder.

	- Proprietor: Avery Sonshal, human mage

- Counting House - Lower City (The Steeps). 
	- The bank of Baldur’s Gate. Possible adventure hooks: This bank is very well-guarded, with stone golems and water elementals in the vaults below. The proprietor, Rakath Glitterbeard, is a corrupt and organized official who serves as treasurer for the Honorable Order of Moneylenders. He’s also the Guild kingpin for the Steeps, controlling the lesser loan sharks and knee-cappers who cater to the city’s more desperate credit risks, along with its outright thieves. Robbing the bank, with Glitterbead’s reputation, its formidable defenses 

	- Proprietor: Rakath Glitterbeard, dwarf

- Garmult’s House of Mastery - Lower City (Eastway). 
	- Offers martial training and a hangout for the Bannerless Legion crew. Kind of an alehouse, kind of a shop, so I kind of put it in Other as it didn’t totally fit either of those categories above completely. Anyone can pay to study here, but only official Bannerless Legion members can hang out and find work. Anyone who wants to join the Legion spars with Garmult. Friendly, non-lethal sparring between members is common.

	- Proprietor: Garmult, agender human

- Harborside Hospital - Lower City (right by Cliffgate in Brampton). 
	- You can find clerics here to heal you. Conveniently located right by the cemetery!

- Hissing Stones - Lower City (Seatower). 
	- A bathhouse known for its discretion. Totally neutral. The primest venue for paid companionship in Baldur’s Gate due to said neutral discretion. No one who enters the bathhouse is allowed to bring weapons or armor of any kind to encourage this neutrality. Many members of the Reveler’s Union make this their home base.

	- Proprietor: Merilyn Allaryr, moon elf

- Jopalin’s - Lower city (Eastway). Tea shop. 
	- Possible adventure hook: Joplin puts the addictive sable moonflower into the tea of customers who strike him as vulnerable. They develop an addiction to it, ensuring a steady supply of returning customers. The super-addicted ones end up in the moonflower den he has in the seedy basement of the establishment, watched over by thugs. Jopalin lives above the tea shop, and his home is heavily booby-trapped.

	- Proprietor: Jopalin, half-elf
- Sorcerous Sundries - Lower City (Heapside). 
	- Place to buy and sell magic items. He has 500 gp to buy magical items so you cannot sell anything worth more than that. Possible adventure hook: The proprietor’s apprentice, Gilligunn (female gnome) is actually working with the Guild. Whenever anyone buys or sells something valuable she alerts the Guild and they steal the item or money. The proprietor is not happy about this but doesn’t really have the means to put an end to it. 

	- Proprietor: Rivalen Blackhand, human

- Danthelon’s Dancing Axe - Outer City (Wyrm’s Crossing). 
	- Two-story adventurer’s shop! All of the adventuring goods. Possible adventure hook: A group of smugglers recently went missing in the Riverveins tunnels along with a chest full of valuable magic potions. Danthelon is encouraging adventurers to go figure out what happened. 

	- Proprietor: Entharl Danthelon, shield dwarf

- Garynmor Stables and Menagerie - Outer City (both Stonyeyes and Blackgate). 
	- Biggest stables in the outer city, with the added benefit of having stables on both sides, so you can leave your horses there and have them brought to the opposite side if you’re passing through the city (which does not allow animals larger than a peacock inside). 

- Hamhocks Slaughterhouse - Outer City (Sow’s Foot - 
	- Possible adventure hook (that goes really well with Avernus!): The owner of the Slaughterhouse was recently murdered by a leader of the Cult of the Dead Three. Since then, the Cult has taken it over and has been using it to murder people, dropping their dead bodies in the alleyway by the Smilin’ Boar. 

	- Proprietor: Pasque Enrial, a black gauntlet of Bane
### **Religious**
 Hall of Wonders - Upper City (Temples). 
	- Displays inventions wrought in Gond’s name. Gigantic treasure vault hidden below.
- High House of Wonders - Upper City (temples). 
	- Gond’s workshop. Very little oversight, clerics of Gond can and will do what they want to be innovative. Can ostensibly heal but they’re almost certainly too busy being innovative. 
- Lady’s Hall - Upper City (Manorborn). 
	- Tymora’s temple (lady of luck.) Where most citizens go to for help, not trusting the actual people in charge. The clergy will on occasion petition the government on behalf of a citizen with an especially troubling story, though this is rare. 
- Unrolling Scroll - Upper City (The Wide). 
	- Temple to Oghma. Popular for weddings and ceremonies. Legend says that bards who stare in the reflecting pool for the day will receive inspiration. 
- Watchful Shield - Upper City (Manorborn). 
	- Helm’s shrine. Regularly attended by Watch member and Flaming Fist members. Helm’s clerics provide healing to any willing to make a donation in gold or arms. They uphold a long-standing tradition of waving this donation for those who suffer grievous wounds in the course of defending other.
- Shrine of the Suffering - Lower city (Heapside). 
	- Run by a really nice halfling priest (Brother Hodges) and his two kids (Hansen and Sissa). They offer healing, alms, and help to the poor. They also offer a form of very cheap burial wherein a person can bring the corpse to the crypts below and have it devoured by rats. Possible adventure hook: a carrion crawler has recently come up to the crypts and began devouring the corpses instead. Brother Hodges will pay to have it dealt with. 
- Water Queen’s House - Lower City (The Steeps). 
	- Temple to Umberlee. Citizens cannot go inside and must ring the bell at the door to give donations and receive prayer. Only waveservants go inside. Possible adventure hook: The waveservants give their donations to Sahuagin who come to grab them every so often and leave the ships of Baldur’s Gate alone because of it. If the waveservants DO want a ship attacked, they leave a magical clam that tells the Sahuagin what to attack. 
- Church of Last Hope - Outer City (Twin Songs). 
	- No specific faith: caters to the depressed and mentally ill. Church/asylum. Most who end up here are either brought by concerned family members or invited by the head priest, Mother Aramina, who used to live in Candlekeep. How she comes to know that someone is suffering is a mystery. Possible adventure hook: The Faithless, a guild-associated Twin Songs gang, has been eyeing up the place. Mother Aramina 



**Inns/Taverns**
Helm and Cloak - Upper City (Temples). 
	Random assortment of people (bards, nobles, adventurers). Two different buildings (Helm and Cloak). Home of the Knights of the Unicorn, patriar adventurers of some renown.
	
	Proprietors: Vedren and Halesta (human, retired Knights of the Unicorn). 
	
Three Old Kegs - Upper City (Temples). 
	Popular amongst the Flaming Fist. Simple and hearty meals, rooms for rent (short- and long-term), laundry, mending, blade sharpening, etc., are available. All cooks and servants are widows of FF members. Occasionally hosts fundraisers for Flaming Fist members. 
	
	Proprietors: Alstan, Brunkhum, and Klalbrot Wintersides, good-hearted men who are taken advantage of by grifters with alarming frequency. 
	
Blade and Stars - Lower City (Eastway). 
Possible adventure hook: The previous proprietor of the Inn, Aurayaun, disappeared recently with the famous shield that the Inn is named after. Her wife, Lupin, who now runs it, believes foul play occurred. A vagrant stated he saw Aurayaun climb up to where the shield was and then vanish with it. Exactly what happened, no one knows. Lupin is willing to pay to find out.
	
	Proprietors: Lupin, Aurayaun (missing)
	
Blushing Mermaid - Lower City (Heapside). 
The bawdiest, most dangerous, most infamous inn in Baldur’s Gate. Your likelihood of getting into a brawl increases enormously at this inn. You can stay here for the night if you want. You probably don’t want to. Possible adventure hook: Many contacts for the seedier parts of Baldur’s Gate have rooms here. If you’re seeking out one of the guild bosses, or a similarly bad person, this might be where you start.
	
	Proprietor: ? The book literally doesn’t say. :(
	
Elfsong Tavern - Lower City (Eastway). The famed tavern that sells good food, has a bunch of people playing board games and Baldur’s Bones and stuff, with rooms to rent, and a disembodied voice that sings every so often. Popular place. The staff do not intervene in fights unless a staff member is involved. Human bartenders are named Falten and Yimiur. Bouncers are a half-ogre named Skoona and a suit of animated armor named Klank. 
	
	Proprietor: Alan Alyth, half-elf. 
	
Low Lantern - Lower City (Eastway). A tavern and gambling/meeting place on an old, derelict ship. Serves drinks and snacks, no meals. Two kenku bartenders and six bouncers. This is a place that only attracts the poor, generally.
	
	Proprietor: Laraelra Thundreth, human
	
Smilin’ Boar - Lower City (Bloomridge). Menu consists of breakfast foods with salacious names. Possible adventure hook: Someone has been killing people and leaving them in the alley outside the Smilin’ Boar. The serial killer has been dubbed the Sickle Man. Business is plummeting. All victims have curved slices across their wrists and a pierced heart. Jentha will pay someone to figure out what is going on. In actuality, this is part of the Cult of the Dead Three, and they are operating out of Hamhocks Slaughterhouse. 
	
	Proprietor: Jentha Allinamuch, halfling

**Government**
High Hall - Upper City (Temples). 
	Seat of government. The Parliament of Peers and the Council of Four meet here, and each of the four dukes has a sumptuous office and discreetly appointed meeting rooms. Criminal trials, tax counts, and professional guild meetings also take place in the High Hall. Contains libraries of records and trial courts, as well as a museum of the history of Baldur’s Gate.
	
Watch Citadel - Upper City (Citadel). 
	The headquarters of The Watch who guard the Upper City. High Constable and Master of Walls Osmurl Havanack runs it and is a good guy who runs it with as much integrity as he can, though he can’t do everything. 
	
Seatower of Balduran - Lower City (Seatower). 
	The headquarters of the Flaming Fist. A fortress designed with artillery and stuff to ward off harbor attacks. Possible adventure hook: This is Baldur’s Gate’s prison. It also houses a full armory, a treasure hoard, a priceless library of texts, and other expensive items. It’s very hard to break into and harder to break out of.
	
Sewer Keep - Lower City (Seatower). 
	Ostensibly where sewage for the city is treated. In actuality, possible adventure hook: the headquarters of the Sewerkeepers crew, who are thieves. They use the pipes and sewer system to burglarize and move goods. Genamine Kopali, the leader, is also the Guild Kingpin of this neighborhood. They do have actual druids and some shambling mounds who keep the sewers operational and purify the waste. Mortlock Vanthampur pays Genamine for information she gleans from her operations. 
	
	Proprietor/Leader: Genamine Kopali, human
	
Wyrm’s Rock - Outer City (Wyrm’s Crossing). 
	Flaming Fist fortress. Taxes travelers (5 cp). Possible adventure hook: The commander recently died. His replacement, a shield dwarf mage named Gardak Horn, is not liked by the guards there because he spies on them with a homunculus. 

**Other**
The Undercellar - Upper City (The Wide, subterranean). 
	A vast network of storage chambers, ale cellars, and cobwebbed tunnels. Dozens of ways in. Seedy place, full of speakeasies and brothels and stuff. Never policed. Their “indulgence rooms” offer gambling, prostitution, exotic intoxicants, and pit fights between animals. Also hosts black and grey markets. Possible adventure hook: So many. Supposedly there are many entrances that lead into the bottoms of wealthy homes. Black markets have treasure stored in guild-protected rooms. Pit fights. All of the stuff above. Tons, and tons, and tons of crazy shenanigans could occur here.
	
	Proprietor (Ruler, really): Heltur “Ribbons” Ribbond, human assassin. Sounds like a psychopath.
	
Insight Park - Lower City (Brampton). 
	Possible adventure hook: Location of the Drawing Tree, a tree that the druid who created the park, Torimesh, personally tends. No one knows the origins of the tree except him. The tree’s bark cracks and curls away, revealing prophecies that come to pass. Anyone else who tries to get the tree to render a prophecy faces Torimesh’s rage. 
	
	Proprietor: Torimesh, shield dwarf 
Balduran Looks Out to Sea - Outer City (Tumbledown). 
	Possible adventure hook: His gaze, if you follow it, leads to a forested tomb known colloquially as Balduran’s Tomb now. No one has yet entered it and discovered its secrets. 
	
Cliffside Cemetery - Outer City (Tumbledown). 
	A massive maze of crypts and mausoleums and graves. Caverns have been expanded and maps poorly updated or lost so no one really knows what all is there. Possible adventure hook: 1) There’s tons of treasure buried haphazardly in the crypts somewhere. 2) The undead of various kinds show up here a lot since there’s so many skeletons and bones and stuff. Leone Wen, a Knight of Torm and leader of the Gravemaker’s Crew, is constantly looking for new people to help deal with the undead. The crew operates out of the half-burned-down wreck of the ols Szarr mansion in the middle of the cemetery. 3) The old Szarr mansion may or may not be haunted with the ghosts of its murdered inhabitants.
	
Little Calimshan - Outer City (Little Calimshan). 
	A traditional calisite settlement that has its own guard, own rules, and isn’t particularly friendly to people from Baldur’s Gate. Given the depth of detail for this little city-within-a-city, I recommend just reading the book for this place. Possible adventure hooks: So many. It’s a tiny little world unto its own, they don’t like people from Baldur’s Gate, the young want more to do with the outside while the older isolationists do not, and there’s a gang war going on inside, plus serious income inequality. 
	
	Contained within Little Calimsam: Calim Jewel Emporium, the best jewelery shop in the city and a place to fence stolen gems, run by a Guild kingpin who is also half Calishite; the Garden of Whispers, where people can trade Guild secrets; the Lamp of Learning and the Verdashir Academy (also known as the Dervish Academy), which train spellcasters and warriors in the styles of their ancestral homeland; Oasis Theater, see below.

Oasis Theater - Outer City (Little Calimshan). 
	Puts on crazy, outrageous, dangerous performances every afternoon. No set ticket prices. Possible adventure hook: Goodnight, the owner, is in serious debt and needs to either find a way to get money or put on such a crazy, crazy show that he makes what he needs to pay the Guild. 
	Proprietor: Jonas Goodnight, human

Riverveins - Outer City (Tumbledown, along the river). 
	Possible adventure hook: Rumors are that these tunnels, carved out by the river, have hidden treasure in them. Many are flooded, some are half-flooded, currents are an issue. Rumor also has it that Ol’ Cholms, a giant turtle river monster, hides here. 
	
Whitkeep Hostel - Outer City (Whitkeep). 
	Gnomish art commune. Only gnomes can stay there but it is the gathering place of artists, musicians, revolutionaries, dreamers, and radicals of all kinds. Possible adventure hook: Pernilla “Prole” Cabrenock, a rock gnome, and Ardryn Deagle, a rock gnome mage, have apparently teamed up to make something that will “finally strip away the bonds of capital and free the people to flourish.” The Guild and the Flaming Fist would love to pay people to infiltrate and figure out what it is and the threat it poses. 
	
Wyrm’s Crossing - Outer City (Wyrm’s Crossing). 
	An entire little village on a bridge. The Flaming Fist maintains a fortress (Wyrm’s Rock; see in the Government section) here so they can tax travelers. Filled with shops, seedy dive bars, gambling halls, and generally a low class of people. Cheats and criminals. Has a local crew, the Crossers, who enforce that cheaters and criminals should only target travelers. Sweetjen’s Spices sells poisons and drugs (proprietor is an unnamed halfling).
