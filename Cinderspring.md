The Cinderspring was an arcane calamity committed by the rebel [[Eshra]]. Using an arcane artifact of great power, she summoned a great firestorm at the heart of [[Cael Aurion]], destroying the Royal Palace, and much of the old city.

Widely considered to be one of the most heinous acts due to the number of innocent casualties who were caught in the crossfire. Despite this, many side with [[Eshra]] to this day, and say that the lives lost were a small price to pay to free the people from their shackles.
