**Verdin** is a massive tropical skyland in the world of **[[Firmament]]**, renowned for its sprawling, untamed jungles, towering canopies, and ever-evolving magical ecosystem. Once cultivated as an agricultural paradise by a pre-Sundering empire, Verdin was abandoned to the wilds when the cataclysm severed it from the surface. In the centuries since, the island has been overtaken by **sentient flora, arcane wildlife, and gravitational anomalies**, becoming one of the most biodiverse and unpredictable regions in the sky.

The skyland is ruled not by a central authority but by a loose confederation of druidic clans, beastkin tribes, and arcane botanists who believe in living in harmony with the wild magic that pulses through the land. The most prominent settlement is **Thal-Kasa**, a city woven into the treetops using living architecture, where diplomacy and ritual shape the jungleâ€™s fate.

Verdin is currently threatened by the **Black Bloom**, a creeping corruption of unknown origin that warps local plant life into aggressive, hive-minded entities. Some believe it is a symptom of a greater imbalance in the aetherstreams; others whisper that **something ancient and slumbering stirs beneath the roots.**
