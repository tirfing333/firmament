Region Type: Ring-shaped tempest skyland

Description: A jagged archipelago of floating basalt reefs encircles a calm inner island, perpetually lashed by arcing lightning and howling gales. The storm never ceases, and skyships must brave its fury or dive beneath the [[Aethercurrent]] to reach the eye. In the calm center lies a symmetrical island, unnaturally quiet, its stony surface covered in towering ruins shaped like massive tuning forks driven into the earth.

Notable Feature: The "Forkspire Array"—a cluster of metal monoliths etched with storm script—generates pulses of energy matching the lightning cycle.

Secret: The storm is artificial. Beneath the island lies a network of weather-engines—ancient machines from the pre-Sundering age designed to harvest atmospheric energy. These constructs still function, their purpose long forgotten, defended by spark-born elementals that treat intruders as disruptions in the calibration.
