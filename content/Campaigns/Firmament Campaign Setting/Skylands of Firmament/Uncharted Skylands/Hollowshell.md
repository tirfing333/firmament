Region Type: Geode skyland

Description: A colossal sphere of stone, cracked open like a shattered egg. From the outside, it resembles a dead, drifting mass—barren, with pockmarked cliffs and dusty terrain. But within its broken shell lies a pocket world of inverted gravity. Waterfalls fall upward from glowing pools, crystal trees grow along the walls of the cavernous ceiling, and winged wildlife flits between hanging gardens suspended on shifting air currents.

Notable Feature: Massive murals line the interior surface—great circular tapestries of colored stone and crystal, forming what may be celestial maps or forgotten epics.

Hazards: Navigation is disorienting; gravity shifts depending on proximity to the inner surface. Ropes, grapples, and magical anchors are required to traverse.

Rumors: Some explorers speak of “mirror-echoes”—phantom versions of themselves glimpsed across the void of the shell, watching silently before vanishing.
