_“A shard of winter sky adrift in [[Firmament]]—ancient, glacial, and unyielding.”_
### **Overview**

The **Frozen Veil** is a massive sky island resembling a **floating iceberg**, perpetually wreathed in mist and glittering frost. It lies in the **northern reaches of [[Firmament]]**, home to **hardy clans** that endure an arctic climate of snowstorms, icy cliffs, and deep frozen caves. The skyland's isolation and brutal conditions have forged a **resilient, proud culture** that blends ancient traditions with magical adaptations for survival.

### **Culture & Clans**

The inhabitants are **clan-based**, reminiscent of waterbending tribes or the peoples of Icewind Dale. Each clan holds its own territory and customs, but they all share deep reverence for the land, spirits of nature, and the **Primarch Conclave**, the druidic order seeking to restore ecological balance across the skylands.

The major clans are:

- **[[Snowfang Clan]]** – Known for beast taming and fierce ice-borne warriors.
    
- **[[Frostveil Clan]]** – Seers, shamans, and historians who preserve oral lore.
    
- **[[Bearclaw Clan]]** – Stronghold builders and defenders of tradition.
    
- **[[Coldbreaker Clan]]** – Ice miners and stoneworkers, often working in the depths of glacier-caves.
    

They survive through **icefishing**, **fungi foraging in glacial caverns**, and **trading carved bone, spirit-wood, and frost-crystals**.

### **Skywhales and Riders**

Among the most honored in the Frozen Veil are the **[[Skywhale]] Riders**—elite warriors and scouts who bond with **skywhales**, majestic creatures adapted to ride **aethercurrents**. These massive beasts are somewhere between dolphins and orcas, bearing **wing-like fins** and a deep connection to the aetheric winds that link the skylands. Some say skywhales **inspired the first [[Skyskiff]] designs**.

### **Magical & Environmental Features**

- The island is **rich in old druidic sites**, ancient stone circles half-buried in permafrost.
    
- Strong **aurorae and leyline turbulence** cause strange magical effects at night.
    
- Rare **frost runes** and **living ice** are said to grow in remote sanctuaries.
    

### **Themes**

- **Survival and adaptation** in harsh environments.
    
- **Ancestral memory and tradition** carried forward in oral and spiritual ways.
    
- **Connection to the natural world**, especially through the Primarch Conclave.
    
- **Isolation vs. connection**—the Frozen Veil often remains apart from the more industrialized skylands like [[Cael Aurion]] or [[Agnia]], but is slowly being drawn into their affairs.

The **Frozen Veil** is a massive arctic sky island located on the far edge of [[Firmament]]. Resembling a colossal iceberg suspended in the heavens, it is home to howling blizzards, sheer cliffs of blue ice, and deep glacier caves glowing with bioluminescent fungi.
