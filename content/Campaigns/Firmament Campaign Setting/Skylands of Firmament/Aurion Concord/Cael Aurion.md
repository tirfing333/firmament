# **The History of Cael Aurion**

_“City of Skyfire, Crown of the Concord.”_

**Cael Aurion** was once a gleaming marvel of the old world, a metropolis lifted whole into the sky during the cataclysmic event known as the **Sundering**. As the world below fractured, the city’s greatest arcanists enacted a powerful rite, severing Cael Aurion from the breaking earth and preserving it aloft with minimal damage. In the centuries that followed, it stood as a **pristine monument to the lost age**, ruled by noble bloodlines steeped in ancient magic. Skyskiffs were invented in Cael Aurion roughly 1200 years ago. The first trade routes between the skylands began to form at this time. Two centuries of splendor and fortune would grace the Aurion empire as the city entered into a golden era of magical technology.

This era of splendor would not last.

Around **1,000 years ago**, the city was consumed by civil war. The **Cinderspring Rebellion**, led by the revolutionary **[[Eshra]]**, erupted from the oppressed lower castes. Fueled by resentment, desperation, and a belief in rebirth, the rebellion overthrew the ruling arcane elite in a storm of flame and fury. Grand towers fell. Vaults of knowledge burned. The Palace of Concordance was shattered. Though [[Eshra]]’s revolution ended aristocratic rule, it also **destroyed much of the city's magical heritage**.

In the aftermath, the once-unified sky island fractured politically. **Smaller outlying towns**, once subordinate to Cael Aurion, rose to power, forming what is now known as the **Aetherion Concord**. Cael Aurion remains the symbolic heart of the Concord, but its supremacy was never restored.

Today, Cael Aurion is a city of contrasts: ancient stone foundations wrapped in new steel, torn murals repainted with revolutionary iconography, and a population split between reverence for the past and loyalty to the fire of progress. [[Eshra]] is still debated in the streets—**liberator or destroyer**—and her legacy smolders beneath every debate in the Assembly chambers.

The city looks like a hodgepodge of copper, bronze, steel, gears, skyships, wooden shacks, all built atop crumbling marble and stone slabs from the pre-rebellion era. What was once called the Golden City, now goes by the moniker "The Bronze City".
## **The Rise of the Fractured Concord**

In the wake of the rebellion, Cael Aurion has rebuilt itself, but it has never had the iron grip it once held over the region since. Instead, many of the smaller towns and outposts across the sky island—once secondary settlements—formed a loose alliance that would become the modern Aurion Concord, meant to keep the balance between the city states and the remnants of Cael Aurion.

These towns:

- Took in **refugees and scholars** displaced by the rebellion.
- Preserved **fragments of lost lore** in secret or reconstructed new traditions from the ruins.
- Each developed **their own political identity**, some based on **guildcraft**, others on **communal living, commerce, or technomagic innovation**.

Cael Aurion remains the **symbolic heart** of the Concord, but it is **no longer the crown**. Its voice is **just one among many**, and some Concord cities would happily see it fade entirely.

Factions:

The Emberhold Guild
- A collection of smaller towns and cities in the eastern parts of Cael Aurion. The majority of these states favored [[Eshra]]'s actions, some even participating in the Cinderflame Rebellion.


The City of Velgrave
- An isolated mountain city, whose geography and isolated nature led it to become a bastion for hidden pro-Auric factions escaping the chaos of the Rebellions. 

Cael Aurion
* The survivors of the Cinderspring rebellion eventually formed a democratic government vying for the interests of whoever was left in the wake of the rebellion. Under the supervision of the Concord, the guilds of Cael Aurion have managed to gain some semblance of leadership again. However, some say that remnants of the old government move in the shadows, and undermine the progress achieved since the rebellions.
