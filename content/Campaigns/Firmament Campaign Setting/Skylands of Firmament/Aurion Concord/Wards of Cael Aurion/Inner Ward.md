Orderly streets gleam beneath magelights, and floating carriages hum along aether-guided tracks. The Inner Ward is the city’s arcane jewel—home to bureaucrats, scholars, and powerful guilds. Here, the remnants of old Aurion’s prestige linger in polished spires and elegant domes. Magitek automata maintain the infrastructure, and enchantments keep the streets clean. To live here is to bask in the illusion that the Cinderspring Rebellion never happened.
