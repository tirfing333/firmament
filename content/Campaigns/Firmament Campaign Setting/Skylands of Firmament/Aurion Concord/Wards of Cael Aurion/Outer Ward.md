The weathered edge of [[Cael Aurion]], the Outer Ward sprawls beneath patchwork steamhouses and crooked towers of rusted brass. Here, life clings on without the benefit of government maintenance or magical upkeep. Tinkerers, drifters, and the dispossessed form tight-knit communities, their ingenuity keeping the engines of daily life sputtering forward. Smoke stacks blur the skyline, and street life buzzes with rough charm and hard-earned survival.

## The Tangle
A collapsed residential quarter overtaken by hanging rope bridges, makeshift ladders, and rusted scaffolding. Known as the Cradle Tangle, it's a chaotic warren where orphans, runaways, and old rebels hide from the world above. The deeper one ventures, the stranger it becomes. Parts of the Tangle dip into remnants of the old city's foundations.
