### The Hollow Skyland

**“What was once buried now watches the sky.”**

**Geography & Structure:**  
Umbrahal is not built upon a mountain—it _is_ the mountain. During the Sundering, an entire underground metropolis was ripped violently from the depths of the world. The cataclysm tore open its **western cavern wall**, exposing the heart of the city to the open sky for the first time in its history. This rift now forms the **Earth Maw**, a vast, jagged cliffside that opens onto the aethercurrents.

Skyships descend into **ancient stone skyports** that cling like spiderwebs to the vertical expanse. From there, the city winds inward through stone galleries, spiral-cut passages, and massive stalactite bridges, all lit by glowing fungus and crystalline veins.

Above the city, **tunnels spiral upward into the interior of the floating mountain**, where forge-fires burn, deep gnome enclaves glimmer, and duergar mines delve toward the core.

### **Skyports of the Maw**

Once a collapsed cavern edge, now the center of trade and danger. These open-air docks, carved and reinforced with duergar blacksteel, are guarded by vigilant drow sentinels. Incoming vessels are _strictly regulated_, and few outsiders are allowed deeper access without sponsorship or tribute.
