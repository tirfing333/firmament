### **Welcome to [[Firmament]]**

Over two thousand years ago, a magical cataclysm known as the **Sundering** shattered the surface of the world, tearing it apart and casting vast landmasses into the sky. These floating fragments, colloquially known as skylands now drift across a boundless sky, held aloft by arcane energies that surged from the planet's wounded core.

The modern age is a time of exploration and peril, invention and forgotten truths. Steam-driven industry and ancient magics collide across this fragmented world, where skyskiffs sail the invisible currents of the wind known as **aethercurrents**, and adventurers chase legends among the clouds.

Welcome, traveler, to the world of **[[Firmament]]**.

### **The Age of Sky and Steam**

In the present era, measured as **After Sundering (A.S.)**—nations and peoples have adapted to life in the sky. Trade routes now connect skylands via daring [[Skyskiff]] crews and zeppelin convoys, and explorers venture into the unknown reaches beyond charted maps. This era is marked by a few major powers:

- The **Aurion Concord** — A loose alliance of post-revolution city-states, built atop the ruins of the old [[Cael Aurion]] Empire. Once the leaders of aethertech studies and military power, the former superpower fell thousands of years ago during the Cinderflame Rebellion, in which the infamous [[Eshra]] the Flameborn led a civil uprising against the former Aurion Government.
- The **Holy State of [[West Arcania]]** — A theocratic skyland whose people believe they were divinely chosen to survive the Sundering. West Arcania was so named because only the western half of Old Arcania survived the Sundering.
- The **Primarch Conclave** of [[Verdin]] — Remnants of an ancient order of Druids, dedicated to preserving life after the Sundering. They continue to send their druids on pilgrimages to both study and preserve the chaotic ecosystems born from the Sundering and its magical energies.
- The [[Umbrahal Alliance]], an alliance between the races of what used to be the Underdark. The city underneath [[Umbrahal]] Mountain was lifted into the sky during the Sundering, and the remnants of the Underdark Civilization formed the [[Umbrahal]] Alliance.
- The sandy dunes of **Agnia** are home to the greatest alchemists and artificiers across the skylands of [[Firmament]]. Much of this is due to the vast plains of magical sandglass, whose resources have led to advancements in both fields (as well as countless others) at the Grand Agnian Academy. It was here that the sandglass Zeppelins were developed.
- **The Frozen Veil** is a broad descriptor for the ice covered skylands that lie to the north. The frozen clans of the region are diverse in customs. Rumors say that the clans have traversed the skylands for years atop the backs of skywhales.

### **Skyskiffs and Aethercurrents**

Travel across the skylands is possible due to a few key inventions:

- **Skyskiffs**: Small, agile airships that ride magical aethercurrents. Originally invented around 1000 A.S. in [[Cael Aurion]].
- **Sandglass Zeppelins**: Large floating aircrafts that make use of the magical and sturdy properties of Agnian sandglass to travel through the sky. Often used by traders to transport cargo, travelers, civilian passengers, or large military forces. Invented around 1000 A.S.
- **Skywhale Riding**: It is said that the clans of the Frozen Veil have used Skywhales to travel between the northern skylands since before the invention of the [[Skyskiff]].
- **[[Aetherstone]] Engines**: Crystalline power sources developed during the Age of [[Aetherstone]] (1600–1900 A.S.) that allow ships to move independently of the currents. The discovery of [[Aetherstone]] is what bridged the gap between skylands that do not have known Aethercurrents between them.

Skiff captains are folk heroes in their own right, leading brave crews into uncharted sky to map new lands, recover ancient relics, and battle skyborne threats.

### **Skyborne Legends**

- **[[Captain Vexa]] of the Gleaming Hawk** – A legendary sky pirate known for her prowess in [[Skyskiff]] skirmishes, legendary heists, and irreverent wit.
- **Vurm'Zakar, the Core-Drake** – A primordial wyrm said to slumber beneath [[Umbrahal]]. Some people in the region believe that Vurm'Zakar shall one day rise again.
- **The Builders** – A half-mythic civilization whose ancient pre-Sundering technology can still be found throughout the world of [[Firmament]]. Their works still lie buried in ruins.

### **Aether and Magic**

The lands are connected by Aethercurrents, zones with significant magical energy, that emerged after the Sundering. Aethercurrents can alter the minds of the magically sensitive, and exposure to unstable magic zones can mutate or awaken powers.

**Aether Navigators**—mages trained to read currents and steer ships. They are vital crew members in any skyskiff crew.

### **Adventure Awaits**

Whether you're a relic hunter delving into skyland ruins, a smuggler running [[Aetherstone]] through storm-choked skies, or a renowned skyskiff captain, the skylands of [[Firmament]] await.

Take to the skies. Seek your legend. And beware the storm that never ends.

**The skies are open. The world is broken. Your story begins now.**
