The Opening Scene:

We join our intrepid heroes atop the deck of a ship. Looking over the side of the ship, rather than open water, you notice sky and clouds as far as the eye can see. You are sailing aboard the merchant [[Skyskiff]], *The Gilded Gale*, voyaging from the city of Emberhold in the eastern parts of the floating sky island of [[Cael Aurion]].

Players would you please describe your characters, what they look like, what class you are, and anything else you would like to share about them.

Below the decks of the Gilded Gale, crammed in a crate, we meet the bugbear Gloomstalker stowaway....


A short distance away, adrift in an escape boat, we find...

The Overarching Story

The Theocracy of West Arcania has begun a new crusade. There have been rumors of raids upon isolated skylands up north. Emboldened by the military prowess of a High Archpaladin [[Corrinth Dorn]], the Armies of the West Arcanian Empire carve a cruel path across the western skylands. The Theocracy has claimed dominion over all property within their lands. Merchant Vessels and Independent airships have been boarded and claimed violently by the theocracy.

The player characters find themselves upon the Gilded Gale. a merchant and passenger vessel voyaging from [[Cael Aurion]] towards Verdin, and land of lush jungles, giant trees, and wildlife. 

Aboard the deck of the ship, we find playing their fiddle upon the prow of the ship, is our bard [[Philomena]].

The captain of the ship, [[Captain Caelum Halstrom]], a Dark haired, tan skinned rock dwarf wearing a brown vest atop a white shirt. He wears a black captain's hat and leans slyly on am ornate wooden walking stick.

The merchant vessel is blown off course and finds itself within the outskirts of West Arcanian territory. The ship is chased down by Lieutenant Fennwick Solwin, a young human paladin, devoted to his church and eager to prove himself to higher command.

"By order of the Holy Church of Sol, you are trespassing in West Arcanian territory and we demand that you lay down arms and surrender."

The Paladins board the merchant vessel. They demand to see the captain. The players see the captain stride forth and nervously address the paladin.

"Uh-hullo ser. I'm sure this must be some sort of mistake. You see I can show you my papers rig---"

The paladin stabs the merchant through his chest. "Unchosen, You will not sway me, deceiver."

"Knights, take control of the ship."

While this is happening we cut to underneath the deck of the ship. Here, in the cargo hold, hidden in a large crate, we find two more of our intrepid heroes.
