### **Appearance:**
Corrinth Dorn is a clean shaven, man with long brown locks that surround a stern face. He is calculated and reserved in his speech, and soft spoken. Despite this, his words carry a sinister power and fear amongst his men.

---

### **Backstory:**

- Endlessly ambitious and self serving.
- He is trained in light magic.

"Why? Why do this?"
"For myself."

Corrinth Dorn is the youngest Arch Paladin in the history of West Arcania's long military history. Renowned for his intensely powerful control over light magic. He has a sharp tactical mind and strives to gain personal power. He manipulates people around him and is bewitchingly charming to his soldiers, compelling them to pledge their lives to his service.

Personality Traits:
He gives off an extremely calm, and benevolent aura, however, a highly perceptive person might detect the insincerity behind his demeanor. He believes he is above others, but knows how to play any role in the moment in order to advance towards his aims. Highly manipulative and intelligent.

---

### **Core Philosophy:**

He is self-serving. He sees the church as a means to gain power. He does not truly believe in the doctrine of West Arcania, but he masterfully is able to fake it to the point where none would ever doubt his devotion.

He is well studied and knows of the Book of the Queen, once belonging to an ancient enemy of the West Arcanian Empire, Lich Queen Helania Vlanith. He wishes to gain the book to conduct a ritual at the Moonlight Tower on the skyland of Verdin, hidden in the vast jungle. The Moonlight Tower, of builder origin, requires a key to access. He has ascertained that a builder construct is needed to gain access to these facilities. The Moonlight Tower is a conduit for harnessing energy from Lune's light.
