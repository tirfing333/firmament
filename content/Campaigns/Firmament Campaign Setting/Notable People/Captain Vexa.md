Race: Orc

Reputation: One of the most elusive navigators in [[Firmament]]’s skies. Formerly a chartmaster in the Aurion Concord’s royal fleet, she vanished during a doomed expedition and returned with a new ship—and new eyes.

Skiff: The Gleaming Hawk, a sleek, glass-winged dart of a vessel, rumored to glide along microcurrents no other skiff can detect. Her crew claims she “sees the world in threads.”

Tactics: Avoids direct combat—prefers sudden dives, wind-dances, and vanishing maneuvers that leave enemies chasing their own contrails.

Legend: Vexa once escaped an imperial blockade by charting a course through an unrecorded current in the skies.

Crew:

- Ordon Lurnell - A halfling scholar, the navigator for the ship.
- Kira Brightglass - A human storm sorceress. With her control of wind, she helps to steady the Gleaming Hawk in difficult conditions. A powerful spellcaster.
- Stephen Rey - A swashbuckling rogue. The lookout for the Gleaming Hawks.
