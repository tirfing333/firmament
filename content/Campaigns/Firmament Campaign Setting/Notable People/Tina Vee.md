Hey! I'm Tina, the best mechanic this side of Cael Aurion, or any side for that matter. I've devoted my life to studying skyships. Ever since my pops brought me to the Aurion Skyport back when I was young, all I've wanted is to sail the skies, and work on ships. I'm great with a wrench and tools, and no one knows skyships better than me!

Backstory: 

Tina's adopted grandfather is an old skypirate, Raiya Barrowfoot. His days of sailing have been put behind him after an old sailing injury to his knee. Now, he lives a modest life in the Outer Ward, caring for Tina, who he took in off the streets.

Chances to encounter:
