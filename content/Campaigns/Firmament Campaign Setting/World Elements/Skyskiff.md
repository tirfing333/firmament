**Skyskiffs** are the primary vessels used to travel between the floating skylands of the shattered world. These airships sail along powerful magical wind streams known as **[[Aethercurrent]]s**, using specialized equipment to harness the arcane forces that swirl through the skies.

- **Magical Windsails:** Most skyskiffs are equipped with enchanted sails that catch the [[Aethercurrent]]s, allowing them to glide gracefully between islands. These sails are woven from sky-silk and infused with wind-binding enchantments.
- **[[Aetherstone]] Propulsion:** More modern or advanced skiffs may rely on **[[Aetherstone]] engines**, rare arcane devices powered by [[Aetherstone]]—crystals formed during the Sundering. These engines provide direct propulsion and maneuverability, independent of natural [[Aethercurrent]]s.
- **Hybrid Designs:** Many modern skyskiffs feature a combination of sails and engines, offering the flexibility to travel in calm skies or during unstable magical storms.
The first Skyskiffs were about 17-20' in length. Despite advancements leading to much larger ships, the name Skyskiff has stuck with the population at large.

### **Origins and Lost Secrets**

- **Invention:** Skyskiffs were invented roughly **1000 years after the Sundering** by the **former empire of [[Cael Aurion]]**. Their appearance marked the end of the isolated age and the **opening of inter-island trade and communication**, reshaping the world.
- **Fall of the Empire:** The secrets of their creation were **largely lost** during the **Cinderspring Rebellion** when [[Cael Aurion]]’s magical aristocracy was overthrown and many arcane institutions were burned or dismantled. While the fundamentals of skyskiff technology are well known, many of the leading advancements from [[Cael Aurion]]'s peak are gone.

- **Mystery and Legacy:** Modern shipwrights **replicate and innovate**, but no one fully understands the **original enchantments or engineering** that made the Aurion skyskiffs so resilient and swift.
