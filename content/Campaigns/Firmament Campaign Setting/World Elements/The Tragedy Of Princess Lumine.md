As the players enter the [[Outer Ward]] of Cael Aurion, a large crowd gathers. People are conversing, laughing, and merriment abounds. However as the players approach, the crowd quiets down as a bard wanders onto the stage in front of them and bows.

"Thank you for your patience, the intermission is now over, and we shall resume our performance of The Tragedy of Princess Lumine!"

There is gently applause and clapping from the crowd.

"Before our break, we witnessed the grand announcement of a wedding between the dashing [[Corrinth Dorn]] and Princess Lumine. Corrinth journeyed to the Temple of the Sun to make his vows before the holy order. In his absence, our heroine was distraught with despair being so far from her lover. But with the day of the festivities set, and her wedding dress finally chosen, we now enter Act 3."

	The curtain is drawn and we see a human bard in a tacky blue dress brushing her hair atop her bed.

	"Oh, Corrinth, when shall you return? If only you could be here now. But alas, your vows must be made before the church if we are to be wed. In your absence, I am faint, and weak, but if the sun wills it, I will wait for you."
	
	She puts her brush down, and pulls her blanket over.
	"Only one more night before I can see my love again."
	
	The wizard controlling the lights with prestidigitation stops casting his spell and the stage darkens and Princess Lumine goes to sleep.
	
	Suddenly we see 5 hooded figures emerge from the wings of the stage. They approach the bed as dramatic music swells and they stab the Princess in her sleep.
	
	Hooded Figure 1: It is done, In the light of the Moon. 
	
	The hooded figures take their hoods off, and we see that underneath they are wearing armor that looks vaguely similar to what Marc is wearing, and on their necks are crests of the moon.
	
	Hooded Figure 2: That uppity princess thinks she can just end the war eh? Peace will never right the wrongs that they have committed.
	
	Hooded Figure 1: Right, peace is something only touted by those who sit atop their towers, as far from the conflict as possible. [[Queen Lissandra]]'s spirit will rest well tonight. Quick, we must go.
	
At the mention of [[Queen Lissandra]]'s name, some people from the crowd boo and yell. Marc realizes that he knows [[Queen Lissandra]].

	The assassins exit the stage, and as the lights come back on, we see a human bard with black hair dressed in tacky armor stroll out onto the stage.

	[[Corrinth Dorn]]: Oh dearest Lumine, have thou left this realm? Oh cruel fate! Curse you that hath separated me from her when she needed me most! Alas, I must not despair! If fate hath brought such misfortune, then I say NAY! For fate should fear a man with nothing left to lose. Vengeance shall be wrought. Vengeance I say!
	Corrinth raises his sword as he vows vengeance against the Moon Clan. The lines are cheesy and the delivery could be better, but the crowd is eating it up. There is applause, some people are crying, some are booing the Moon Clan
	
The Bard reenters the stage.
"Thank you, thank you! That was the tragedy of Princess Lumine. Once again we are the Waxen Troupe. Please leave any tips for the performers in the box by the stage. We appreciate your patronage. And come back next week for our performance of 'Sleepless in Umbrahal!'. ''
