###  **The Prologue: A Star Forgotten**

In the high towers of a noble estate, **[[Fana]] Morningstar**, a gifted **human sorceress**, begins her journey not with fire and fury—but with ink and echoes. Adopted into a family of wealth and mystery, her heart is stirred by a book left to her by a father not of blood, but of choice. Upon the opening page, a dedication is scrawled—_“To my Bright Star… and to my World.”_  

And so, when [[Fana]] steps through a door that becomes a **portal to the Infinite Staircase**, her reality cracks. Visions flood her: glimpses of **a  companion**, a **battle once fought**, and **a promise broken by time**.

### ✦ **The Awakening in [[Sigil]]: The City of Doors**

[[Fana]] finds herself cast into **[[Sigil]]**, the city at the heart of all realities. Here, beneath its towering spires and ever-watchful Lady of Pain, her tale truly begins. She is not alone long—for she is swiftly found by **[[Zazir]], a **goblin rogue and streetwise guide**, who offers aid… for a price.

[[Zazir]] asks her help in delivering a **mysterious package** for a Githzerai merchant named **Arvath “Oddments” Nalkari**. Their errand is interrupted by a brutish thug named **Tarsk**, who seeks the package in payment for a debt Zaz owes to him. A scuffle ensues; **[[Zazir]]’s tricks and [[Fana]]’s magic overcome him**, though not without wounds both physical and personal.

### ✦ **The Sensory Stone and the Lost Companion**

The package, once delivered, is revealed to contain a **Black Lotus Bloom**—a flower of **Ethereal origin**, its essence infused with **visions and forgotten truths**. It is brought to **Madame Liriel Voss**, who pays them for their trouble.

Indebted to [[Fana]], Zaz chooses to follow along. After all, this is the most jink he has ever earned in his life.

[[Fana]] journeys to the Veiled Atrium and overcomes many Cranium Rats in her journey into the depths of the Atrium.

The first page [[Fana]] recovers is **The Magician**, granting her strange new power—and clues to the next fragments.

### ✦ **The Choice of Paths – Act 2 Begins**

From here, Fana’s path forks.

#### ➤ **Path of Secrets: The Moon Arcana (Hive Ward)**

[[Fana]] follows a trail of magic from her Arcane Codex towards the Hive Ward. It's not long before entering the Hive Ward that she hears off in the distance a group of thugs threatening a Gith'yanki father and his son. Just as they are about to intervene, they are interrupted by a mysterious orc with a giant shield and axe. Together, the orc, [[Fana]], and Zaz take down the Thugs. Unbeknownst to [[Fana]], they have just harmed thugs belonging to [[Vharrik, the Silver]], and such slights are not forgiven easily in the Hive.

#### ➤ **Path of Love: The Lovers Arcana (Lady’s Ward)**

Another page lies in the hands of **[[Aedrian Caldane]]**, a strict **[[Guvner]]** (lawkeeper) with a dangerous secret—**a forbidden romance** with **Dain Vana**, a firebrand leader of the **Anarchists**. Law and chaos entwined.  
[[Fana]] may choose diplomacy or blackmail, subterfuge or compassion.  
If she aids the lovers in fleeing [[Sigil]], **Aedrian will leave the Lovers Page behind**, embracing love over law.

However, should [[Fana]] wish, she may turn to a **rival [[Guvner]]**, exposing Aedrian’s secret for political leverage, trading hearts for truths.

### ✦ **The Warlock and the World**

[[Fana]]’s destiny is not hers alone. Watching from the void is **Vaelis**, a **human warlock**, once her **guardian, her ally… her blood brother.**

But now, he serves the one known only as **The World**—the Arcana given flesh and malevolence. Vaelis once helped scatter the **Codex’s pages**, **sent [[Fana]] forward through time**, and **erased her memories** to protect her.  
Now, **his mind is twisted**, believing the **Codex must be restored**, unaware that doing so would **unleash the BBEG's grand transformation**—a return to **fate’s inevitable cycle**.

The truth of his identity—and the truth of their past—lies **buried in broken timelines and forgotten dreams**, but **the Codex will awaken it**, page by page.

---

### ✦ **The Emperor’s Challenge – Act 3 Beckons**

Far beyond [[Sigil]], upon the **Plane of Fire**, a new page awaits—the **Emperor Arcana**, symbol of **order and dominion**.

Held by **Sultan Abd al-Malik bin Marwan**, tyrant of the **[[City of Brass]]**, the page is offered as **the prize in a grand tournament**.  
[[Fana]] must **enter the arena**, facing warriors from across the multiverse, each seeking glory.  
To reach this place, she must first bargain with **Agnizzar the Smoldering**, an **efreeti bartender** of the **Embered Chalice** in [[Sigil]]’s Lower Ward. He demands she **deliver a message** to an old flame in the [[City of Brass]]—**Alarra**, a mysterious efreeti who will understand the words:  
**“One spark remains.”**

---

### ✦ **The Truth Beneath All Things**

This journey, spun by the Codex and its Major Arcana, is not merely one of magic or might. It is a **tapestry of fate**, a **labyrinth of memory**, and a **battle against cosmic inevitability**.

[[Fana]], the Star, seeks to **change what was written**—to defy the World’s cycle and reclaim her family, her truth, and perhaps even **Vaelis**, the brother lost to time.

But the Codex is not complete.  
The Arcana are still hidden.  
And the **World watches**, ever patient.
