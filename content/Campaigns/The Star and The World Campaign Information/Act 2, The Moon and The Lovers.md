Not long after entering the Hive, [[Fana]] saves a Gith father and child from some thugs with the help of Thorn Steelgut. Little does she know that interfering may have wrapped her up in more than she bargained for...

[[Fana]] meets Lady Skirra, more commonly known as "[[Lady Skirra, Whispers]]". Lady Skirra recruits [[Fana]] into her cause against Vharrik, and divulges the location of his hideout in exchange for his head. [[Fana]] and company embark to gather intel on Vharrik, pulled by [[Lady Skirra, Whispers]]' thread.

Meanwhile in [[The Lady's Ward]], rumors swirl about a magical artifact falling into the hands of a [[Guvner]] who goes by the name [[Aedrian Caldane]].

[[Aedrian Caldane]], a high ranking [[Guvner]] Lieutenant has confiscated a page from the arcane codex. Fana has entered the Lady's Ward, bought a beautiful dress from the Golden Thread, and has plans to gather intel on her new apparent target.

Aedrian Caldane will soon work security for a Guvner event that Fana intends to scout out.
