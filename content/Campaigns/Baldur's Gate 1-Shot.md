You awaken to the sound of waves and creaking wood. The briny smell of salt and fish begin to envelope you as your consciousness gains its senses. The boat is a trading vessel traveling south along the [[Sword Coast]]. You have been at sea for 3 days now, having left the ports of Neverwinter for greener pastures down south. 

As you walk up the stairs up to the main deck of the ship, the bright light of midday forces your eyes to adjust, as you squint at the vast scenery around you. On the port side of the boat you see the thick stony looking trees of the Trollbark Forest rolling past. To your right the sun shines down across the small archipelagos and islands that dot the [[Sword Coast]].

A gruff old ship captain, Giovanni Ramirez, with a pipe hanging out the corner of his mouth calls out to you. "Not too long until we reach [[Baldur's Gate]]. Nothing quite like returning home. For you though, it's a big brand new world. What are you going to do when you finally reach the city?".

Were you journeying to [[Baldur's Gate]] for...

	A fresh new start?
	A pilgrimage?
	The promise of adventure?
	or anything else?

As the boat reaches the ports of [[Wyrm's Crossing.png|Wyrm's Crossing]], a small town just on the outskirts of [[Baldur's Gate]], you suddenly see a commotion gathering just down the dock.

You see a large chicken like creature, standing at roughly 7 feet tall, with large webbed dragon like wings, and a sharp pointed beak bury its beak into the side of one of the city guard. "[[Cockatrice]]! RUUUUUN! CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY!"

One of the city guards flees the scene. Left there are two young recruits, their knees shaking and bent at the knees. You notice their eyes flitting back and forth between the beast before them and the stunned crowd nearby.

After defeating the cockatrice, the party is informed that a number of mysterious things have been going on at Wyrm's Crossing. Monsters have been coming closer to the edges of town, and Old Greta's livestock have been going missing.

Old Greta is an old Tiefling. Stout and with weathered skin from working the fields. One of her goats has gone missing recently. Investigating her field leads to a faint trail that leads into the [[Cloakwood]].

Navigating the Cloakwood:

The tracks lead to a ford in the river.
- Players will need to cross a deep branch of the River Chionthar. The river branch is 20 feet across and quite deep. The water rushes with a strong current. There are large trees around. How do the characters navigate this conundrum?
