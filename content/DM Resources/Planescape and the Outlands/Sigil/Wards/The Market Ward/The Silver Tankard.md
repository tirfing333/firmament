Ah, The Silver Tankard—a place of strong drinks, stronger personalities, and the occasional bar brawl. With its warm firelight, sturdy wooden beams, and faint scent of ale and pipe smoke, it serves as a haven for weary travelers, scheming merchants, and those looking to drown their troubles.

### The Silver Tankard’s Offerings

(Owned & Operated by* [[Garret “Ironmug” Thorne]]**, a seasoned barkeep with a weathered face and a handlebar mustache.)*

#### ❖ DRINKS

- Ironmug Stout (1 gp) – A heavy, black ale brewed in barrels reinforced with cold iron, leaving a faint metallic aftertaste.
    
- [[Sigil]] Swill (1 gp) – A cheap, strong, and questionably safe ale that leaves you buzzed and slightly disoriented.
    
- Baatorian Brimstone Whiskey (1 gp per shot) – A smoky, red-tinged whiskey distilled with just a hint of hellfire essence.
    
- Feywine (5 gp per glass) – A delicate, shimmering green wine that sings faintly when poured. Those who drink it experience a brief, euphoric clarity.
    
- Celestial Nectar Mead (1 gp) – A honey-rich mead rumored to have been first brewed by archons, leaving a faint golden glow in the drinker’s cheeks.
    
- Mystery Mug (???) – A random drink of the night—you drink, you find out. (May be magical, may be terrible.)

- Zerth Breakfast Platter (50 sp per platter) – A githzerai-style breakfast with flatbread, spiced eggs, and roasted peppers.
