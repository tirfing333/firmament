- A stoic, mechanical-faced modron exile, slightly off from the usual order.
- Rarely speaks unless spoken to, but when he does, his voice is smooth, calculated, and unsettlingly precise.
- Doesnâ€™t comprehend jokes and stares too long.
- Occasionally adjusts himself with a tiny screwdriver mid-conversation.
