- Githzerai merchant with a dry, no-nonsense demeanor.
- Always seems half-distracted, as if listening to something far away.
- Haggles aggressively, but sometimes randomly gives discounts as if driven by unseen logic.
- Doesn't confirm or deny the true nature of his waresâ€”just smirks cryptically.
