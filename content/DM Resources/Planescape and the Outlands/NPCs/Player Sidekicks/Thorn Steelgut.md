###  Backstory
Once a city guard on the edge of the Hive Ward, Thorn uncovered corruption within the Harmonium—his superior selling prisoners to Vharrik the Duskmire’s men. When Thorn tried to expose the crime, he was betrayed, beaten, and left for dead. He awoke in the ruins beneath [[Sigil]], tended by a dying dwarven rune-priest who marked Thorn’s armor and flesh with ancient protective runes. 
Now, Thorn wanders the Hive as a vigilante, shielding the weak, asking nothing in return. He has cast aside his surname, but whispers remain: "Thorn Hollowbrand," named for the strange rune burned upon his back—a mark that glows when danger is near.

- ### Wears rune-etched chain mail and a battered tower shield

###  Personality

 Grim and steady, Thorn is a guardian who speaks plainly but feels deeply. He sees in [[Fana]] something fragile yet powerful—a “candle that won’t go out.” He believes protecting her might be his second chance.

###  First Encounter with Fana

While passing through the Hive Ward, [[Fana]] and [[Zazir]] stumble upon Vharrik’s enforcers harassing civilians. Thorn appears, shield-first, and intervenes with righteous fury. When the thugs are scattered, he says to Fana:
	
	“You’re not from here... but you fight like you care. That matters. Trouble’s walking your way. I’ll walk beside you.”
