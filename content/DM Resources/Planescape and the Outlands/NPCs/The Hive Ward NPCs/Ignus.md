Ignus was once the apprentice of an incarnation of the Nameless One, who was described as a sorcerer of great power. The sorcerer believed in learning from suffering, and subjected Ignus to many torments in order to get him to learn how to become a pyromancer. When he did, he attempted to burn down the Hive, starting with the Alley of Dangerous Angles. As a result, all the spellcasters in [[Sigil]] united against him to put a stop to his killing spree, and converted him into a portal to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. Unbeknownst to the spellcasters, Ignus remained alive, and reveled in his endlessly burning flames. He then became a popular figure at [[The Smoldering Corpse Bar]], and is the reason behind the bar's name. He remained there until the Nameless One freed him.

Ignus is quite obviously psychotic, and takes delight in burning anything, and firmly believes that anything can burn. He is also very powerful, and he apparently has the power to permanently destroy his master, which is something that only a select few beings can accomplish.
