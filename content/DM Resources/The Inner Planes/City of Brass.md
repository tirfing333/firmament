One famous refuge from the destructive heat was the [City of Brass](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/City_of_Brass "City of Brass"), home of the [efreet](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Efreet "Efreet"). At the will of the grand sultan, the city was protected from the pervasive smoke and flames, and visitors enjoyed unrestricted vision and uncomfortable yet tolerable temperatures but walls and surfaces were still hot enough to burn unprotected flesh on contact. The city sat in a bowl of golden brass 40 miles (64 kilometers) in diameter that floated about the plane or hovered over a huge disk of [obsidian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian") that was cracked from the heat. Architecture included soaring towers, grand minarets, and everything from tool sheds to palaces made of brass. The treasure vaults of the grand sultan, and his wrath towards any who attempted to acquire even a single piece, were legendary. Located on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].
