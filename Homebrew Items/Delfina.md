- **Inexperienced Arcane Pilot.** 
	- The Delfina is piloted through casting the Pilot Airship Cantrip. Piloting the ship may involve Arcana checks or use of the pilot’s spellcasting ability in high-pressure situations.

- **Turning.** Turning the ship up to 60° costs 1 space of movement.

**Description**  
A nimble skyship with steel that has been reinforced with scrap from a builder ruin. The Delfina hums with a distinct resonance with its aethercrystal engine, and its light but sturdy frame allows it to maneuver through the skies swiftly while still being able to accommodate close to a medium ship's crewsize. The **Delfina** is a small, fast, and lightly armored vessel perfect for quick escapes and high-risk raids. With limited crew, it demands clever maneuvering and coordination. It once belonged to [[Captain Rieko]] and the Blue Rogues. Now it has fallen into the hands of our intrepid heroes.
