_"We survived not by chance, but by divine selection. The Sundering was not a tragedy—it was the First Revelation."_

### Origin

Once a sprawling metropolis of magical learning and arcane advancement, Arcania was a beacon of high magic and innovation before the Sundering. When the cataclysm came, the eastern half of the city fell—swallowed by the cracking land and molten upheaval. The western portion of the city rose with the sky, seemingly untouched by the chaos surrounding it.

The survivors came to believe this was no accident but a divine deliverance. Over centuries, this belief crystallized into religious dogma.

### Beliefs & Culture

- **The Sundering is Sacred**: Referred to as the _First Revelation_, the people of West Arcania believe the world was broken to purify it. Only those favored by the divine were lifted into the skies.
    
- **Arcane Asceticism**: Despite their magical heritage, Arcanians now treat magic as sacred—not a tool for casual use, but a divine gift. Only the clergy and sanctioned sorcerers may wield it.
    
- **The Sanctum Codex**: A holy text said to contain visions from the moment of Sundering. It is rewritten and reinterpreted across generations by a religious caste of oracles called the _Lexanites_.
    
- **Rites of Skyfire**: A public ritual where chosen citizens are “touched by the flame”—briefly exposed to raw arcane energy as a test of faith. Some emerge empowered. Others... do not.
    

### Government & Power Structure

- The **Archcleric of the Ascended Flame** serves as both spiritual and political ruler.
    
- Supported by a **Council of High Lexanites**, scholars of prophecy and arcane theology.
    
- Law and doctrine are enforced by the **Seraph Guard**—a zealous order of magically armed paladins who patrol the skies and streets with absolute authority.
    

### Influence in [[Firmament]]

- West Arcania is highly territorial and controls one of the largest and most stable sky islands in [[Firmament]].
    
- They produce some of the finest crystalglass, arcane relics, and theological tomes sought across the skies.
    
- Relations with other factions are tense. They often declare islands “blessed” or “condemned” based on prophetic readings, leading to conflicts with secular states and druids alike.
    
- **[[Aetherstone]] is seen as holy**, and unauthorized possession is considered heresy within their borders.
    

### Potential Hooks

- A missionary zeppelin from West Arcania arrives in a neutral port, spreading omens of a "Second Sundering."
    
- A heretical prophet claims the eastern ruins of Arcania still exist—floating, hidden, and full of forbidden knowledge.
    
- A Seraph Guard goes rogue after discovering a suppressed truth about the Sundering’s cause.
