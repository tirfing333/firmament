### _“Those Who Ride the Breath”)

- **Origin:** The Aelariin are an **ancestral order of [[Skywhale]] riders**, considered the spiritual guardians of the [[Frozen Veil]]. Their name derives from an ancient word for the skywind, believed to be the “breath of the world” left behind after the Sundering.

- **Tradition:** Only those who undergo a **rite of passage deep in the glacier-caves** and bond with a [[Skywhale]] pup may earn the mantle of Aelariin. The [[Skywhale]] chooses the rider, not the other way around.

- **Cultural Role:** Revered as **protectors, storytellers, and spiritual leaders**, the Aelariin guide the clans through seasons, storms, and omens. Their songs are said to carry prayers into the [[Firmament]].

- **Connection to Innovation:** Some legends whisper that early Aurion skiff-makers once observed the Aelariin and **tried to mimic the [[Skywhale]]'s natural harmony with the aethercurrents**, leading to the first gliding hulls.
