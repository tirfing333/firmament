# **Agnia, the Gleaming Expanse**

**Overview:**  
Agnia is a vast desert skyland scorched by the Sundering, where intense heat fused the sands into **sunglass**—a radiant, magical glass that now defines its geography, culture, and economy.

Agnia stands as a land of searing beauty and dangerous allure—a place where every reflection may be a lie, and every dune may hide the ashes of gods.

## Water in Agnian Society

Water is **life and memory**—a sacred element shaped by the Sundering’s aftermath. While not worshipped outright, it is treated with **ritual respect**, especially when drawn from rare sources.

---

### **Cultural Practices

### **1. Water Rites and Ceremonies**

- Small rituals mark the **first rain of the season**, the **completion of wells**, or the **gifting of water**.
    
- These acts are not overtly religious, but carry **ancestral respect**—water is believed to **carry echoes of the past**, and blessings are often spoken over new sources.
    

### **2. Raincatchers and Glasswork**

- Agnians are renowned **glasscrafters**, shaping **raincatchers, fluted cisterns**, and **condensation towers** designed to gather water from **aether-heavy skies**.
    
- **Architectural marvels** and **urban necessities**, integrated into buildings, plazas, and caravans.
    

### **3. Oasis Guardianship**

- Most communities are built around **permanent oases**, often with **wards or elemental bindings** to preserve balance.
    
- Select **hydromancers or druids** tend to the oasis' elemental health, ensuring the **spirit of the spring** is respected and not overtaxed.

## **Spiritual Aspects

### **Elemental Harmony**

- Rather than a religion of water, Agnia holds a **broader reverence for elemental harmony**—fire, earth, water, and air must all be **balanced**.
    
- Water, in particular, is seen as the **mediator between fire and earth**, cooling or shaping them into life-bearing forms.
    

### **Pilgrimage to the Shardwell**

- A **natural spring** said to have formed from a **crack in the sky**, where raw elemental water drips through slowly, drop by drop.
    
- Pilgrims come not to worship it, but to **witness its clarity**—believing the stillness of its surface helps **center the mind** and **reveal truths hidden in emotion**.

## **Practical Use and Trade**

### **Water as Commodity, not Currency**

- While valuable, water is **not used as money**—instead, its abundance or scarcity affects **trade, trust, and community strength**.
    
- Trade caravans carry **shardglass containers** of purified water to less fortunate settlements, often protected by **elemental wards or mercenaries**.
    

### **[[Skyskiff]] Condensation Canopies**

- Agnian skyskiffs use **woven canopy sails** treated with special resins to **capture moisture from aetherclouds**.
    
- Not as flashy as tech-based condensers—these are **practical, artisan-built solutions** that reflect Agnia's **craftsmanship over industrialization**.
