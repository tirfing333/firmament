Topics
- Campaign will be R rated, there might be mentions of sex and depictions of violence, but nothing crazier than you would expect in an R rated movie or HBO TV show.
- There will be no sexual violence depicted by the DM and I will not tolerate any RP of it from the players.
- I would prefer if you did not use your phones during the game unless it is an emergency.

Style of game
- I will be basing my DMing style off of Critical Role and Dimension 20 campaigns. 
- The DM and players are not "enemies", collaboratively we will craft a story/experience. I am here to make rulings and pilot the NPCs and monsters.
- There will be some homebrew rules for ship battles as we get further into the campaign
- As much as possible, try to limit metagaming. IE: You may have knowledge about the weaknesses of a mindflayer for example,but your character might not. Do your best to roleplay what your character knows rather than taking actions that only make sense because you have knowledge from outside the game.
