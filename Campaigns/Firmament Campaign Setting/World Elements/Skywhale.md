### **Description**

Skywhales are majestic, airborne leviathans that drift gracefully through the aethercurrents that bind the skylands of [[Firmament]]. Resembling oceanic whales in shape and size, they are distinguished by their massive **wing-like fins**—translucent and luminous with traces of aetherlight—that allow them to soar across the sky. Their skin is smooth, often patterned with **glacial blues, dusky violets, and luminous silvers**, blending perfectly with the celestial skies they call home.

A typical skywhale measures between **20 to 40 feet in length**, with larger elders exceeding 60 feet. Despite their size, they move with near silence, their slow, rhythmic wingbeats resonating with the ambient magical winds.

### **Behavior**

Skywhales are deeply spiritual creatures, often seen in the company of the **[[Aelariin]]**, the elite riders of the [[Frozen Veil]]. They are semi-sapient, capable of forming deep emotional bonds and communicating through low, haunting song-vibrations that ripple through the aether. These songs are believed to influence the flow of currents and can soothe magical turbulence in the air.

They travel in small pods or alone, often following ancient sky routes known only to them. Skywhales feed on airborne aether-bloom spores and glimmering sky plankton found near storm fronts and leyline convergences.

### **Lore**

According to oral tradition among the clans of the [[Frozen Veil]], the skywhales were born from the breath of the world during the Sundering. Their presence is seen as an omen of harmony or change, and many believe their songs carry messages from lost spirits or echo forgotten truths.

Some scholars of [[Cael Aurion]] maintain that the first skyskiffs were inspired by observing skywhales gliding effortlessly across vast distances—leading to the earliest attempts at harnessing aethercurrents through artifice.

### **Abilities**

- **Aether Glide.** Skywhales can ride magical aethercurrents with perfect grace, allowing them to ignore most aerial hazards and navigate through storms with ease.
    
- **Whalesong Resonance.** Once per day, a skywhale can emit a powerful whalesong that calms storms, pacifies hostile beasts, or stabilizes fluctuating magic in a 1-mile radius.
    
- **Bonded Mount.** Only those who have completed the sacred rites of the [[Aelariin]] may ride a skywhale. A bonded rider gains limited telepathic empathy with their whale.
