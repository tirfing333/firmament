Aethercurrents in the world of [[Firmament]] are:

Invisible magical windstreams that weave through the skies between floating islands.

Remnants of the arcane upheaval caused by the Sundering, which shattered the world and lifted landmasses into the air.

Essential for skyship travel, especially for vessels without [[Aetherstone]] engines.

Naturally occurring and ever-shifting, requiring skilled aether navigatorsâ€”mages trained to read and harness their patterns.

Sometimes volatile, unpredictable, or influenced by magical anomalies or rising elemental storms.

Studied by scholars and druids alike for their connection to ley lines and ecological balance.
