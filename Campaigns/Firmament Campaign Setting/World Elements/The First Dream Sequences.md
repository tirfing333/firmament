As you close your eyes, your dreams feel ever so slightly more vivid. You feel aware, present.

	Marc: You feel the warm caress of a gentle blanket on your skin. As you open your eyes to the dream, you realize that the warmth you feel is the light of the moon as your eyes focus on the vast sky. The Moon in its fullness seems to be larger than it normally is. You hear a voice bounce around the inside of your head. "You must keep safe Marc, my champion. May the light of Lune guide you when you feel lost. Great danger is coming, and I fear it may take everything we have to stop it. Stay strong, stay safe."

	[[Mondrian]]: As you put your systems into a more restful state, you begin to sift through your memory banks for information. Beneath arcane symbols connected by pulsing streams of magically electrical energy, you find sets of instructions, deep in the foundations of your code. Directive 1: Serve the Baldurin Empire. Directive 2: Follow the orders of your creators. Directive 3: Never act in a way that would bring harm to your creators.

	As you examine these core tenets, a feeling of unease comes over you. The [[Baldurin]] Empire does not seem to exist in the time period you have awoken in. None of your creators seems to be near, and so you seem to be left with no directives at all. As you realize this, you see a prompt flash into your vision.

	"Create Directive: "


	Keva: You awaken in a field of rolling grass. As far as you can see all around you, there is nothing but wind creating waves upon the yellowish green reeds that surround you. Suddenly you feel it. Gusts of wind, and the low roar of what sounds like a furnace. You are suddenly enveloped in shadow. You look down to see the silhouette of that beast that has haunted you since you can remember dreaming. You see the sharp shadow of horn, wings, and serpentine scales above you as you look up, only to see the warm orange glow of heat, fire, and death approach.

	Philomena: You awaken on the deck of a familiar ship, suddenly you hear a voice, "There they are! Have a drink you spoony bard." You look down to see a wooden tankard in your hand. Bubbly mead swirls in your cup as you look to see who spoke. It is a red haired dwarf, with golden rings tied in his beard. "Don't look so surprised to see me, or have you already moved on? Forgotten about us eh?"

Philomena, who is this dwarf to you?

	"Well, don't look so glum Phil. Remember, once a Crimson Wing, always a Crimson Wing."



	Valanthe: As you meditate in your half awake trance, you suddenly feel a tiredness that feels unnatural. You drift off into an unfamiliar sleep. As you regain awareness in your dreamscape, you realize that although you feel your eyes are open, there is nothing but the pitch black void before you. You open your mouth to make some sort of noise but find that there is no air, no sound to be made. Nothingness lies before you for a long while, until it doesn't as you slowly begin to see a dull white horizon seem to rise in the distance. To your horror, it is not a sun that rises from the horizon, but rather a large pupil, that seems to be staring directly at you, as you realize that this is no horizon, but rather the white of a massive eye. You feel its gaze staring straight into the core your being. No sound, no words, no way to avert your gaze.

	"I see you"
