The Steeltoe Clans are a rugged group who inhabit the mountains in the middle of "World". The Steeltoe Clan is protective of its people and wary of outsiders. They make treks down the mountain into the surrounding wind plains and jungles to hunt for food before returning to their well guarded settlements. They have a tenuous relationship with the Florin Nomads who settle in the Windy Plains.
