The druids of this circle maintain the natural order of the surrounding jungles and forests of their small skyland. 

Structure and Aesthetic:
The druids of this circle dwell in canvas-and-hide structures, teepee-shaped and marked with leaf motifs and druidic sigils, each painted with ochre and other dyes. The camp is nomadic but always returns to the Ceremonial Clearing, a wide jungle hollow where the canopy opens to the sky.

### **Ceremony at the Arrival**

When the players arrive, the Circle is in the midst of a **sacred rite** known as the **Calling of Smoke and Sap**.

- **Purpose:** To honor a fallen comrade, killed tragically in the jungle, and **commune with their spirit** as it passes into the jungle and joins the root-song.
    
- **Procession:** Cloaked druids dance in spiraling circles around a **ritual pyre**, its smoke thick with jungle herbs. A **woven effigy** of the elder, made from bark and cloth, rests on a wooden bier.
    
- **Tone:** The air is **thick with incense**, drums beat like heartbeats, and from the surrounding trees, animal spirits (illusion or real) flicker and vanish in the shadows.

She sees that Valanthe is a "Life Witch", recognizing her power over life and death. If Valanthe acts racist towards her, she will point out the corruption and influence of some vile power that is near.
