Over 2200 years ago, the world was torn apart by a magical cataclysm known as The Sundering.

Without warning, the surface of the world cracked and sundered. Land masses tore away from one another and rose into the sky, forming vast floating islands suspended in the atmosphere. Seas boiled and vanished, consumed by arcane storms of heat, pressure, and raw magical force. At the planet’s core, where the heart of the world once beat, now churns a vast and unstable vortex of energy—a storm of light, molten essence, and broken time. This swirling void became the center of the sky, and around it now spins the broken world, reborn.

Most who live today know little of how the Sundering came to pass. In truth, it was caused by humanoids tampering with the planet’s core, attempting to control the foundational weave of magic itself. Their recklessness shattered the world.

The scattered remnants of the old world now drift across the heavens as a sprawling archipelago of sky islands. In time, this new realm came to be known as Firmament.

The World of Firmament Today
In the two millennia since the Sundering, civilization has endured—and adapted. The world has entered a magic-industrial age. Skyboats—magically propelled vessels—sail between floating islands, threading through channels of mystical wind known as aethercurrents. These magical sky streams are read and traversed by skilled aether navigators, individuals with innate or trained magical sensitivity.

Some skyships, however, are powered by a rare and powerful fuel: [[Aetherstone]]—a radiant crystal formed in the Sundering’s aftermath. These crystals grant ships the ability to travel independent of the currents, making them a vital and jealously guarded resource across Firmament.

Factions and Forces
The Primarch Conclave: A diverse druidic order representing all biomes—arctic, desert, jungle, and more. The Conclave seeks to restore balance to the ravaged natural world and stabilize the wild magic that still surges across the skylands. They view the Sundering as a wound in the world, and their mission is one of healing and protection.

Aether Navigators: Wizards, sorcerers, and other gifted individuals trained to read the sky’s invisible currents and pilot ships through ever-shifting winds and ley-lines.

The Core Storm: At the center of Firmament lies the remnants of the world’s heart—an untouchable region of roiling energy and unspent magic. Few approach it. None return unchanged.

### A Timeline of Major Events in Firmament
## **Pre-Sundering Era (Before 0 A.S.)**

### ~1000–800 B.S. – **The Ascension of the Skybuilders** 

- A half-mythic era described in crumbling tomes and fractured ruins.
- Tales speak of artificer-architects who built floating sanctuaries and leyline engines—precursors to modern skylands and magical technology.
- Some believe their most advanced works, like **Thal-Meraz**, were destroyed or hidden before the Sundering.

### ~500 B.S. – **The Binding of the Core-Drake**

- [[Vurm'Zakar]], the Core-Drake—a primordial beast of molten essence—is sealed beneath the world by a grand alliance of druids, elemental magi, and ancient forgers.
- The binding site is believed to be the heart of what would later become **[[Umbrahal]]**.
- Its thrashing and pain may have cracked the world’s magical core.

### ~100 B.S. – **Collapse of [[Umbrahal]]’s Ceiling**

- A massive quake or magical backlash fractures the upper caverns of [[Umbrahal]].
- During the Sundering, this rupture becomes a gaping opening to the sky.

## **The Sundering (0 A.S.)**

### 0 A.S. – **The Sundering of the World**

- A magical cataclysm shatters the planet’s crust, lifting vast landmasses into the sky.
- The event creates **skylands**, **aethercurrents**, and the first **[[Aetherstone]]** crystals.
- Civilization falls into disarray; much knowledge is lost.

	- **Flight stabilization runes**

- **Arcane weaponry and shielding**
	- Skyships become faster, more reliable, and more dangerous.
	- Industrialization begins in earnest—alongside rising magical pollution.

### **1900–2100 A.S. – The Age of Strain**
